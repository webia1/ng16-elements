## Nx Workspace

<a alt="Nx logo" href="https://nx.dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nrwl/nx/master/images/nx-logo.png" width="45"></a>

âœ¨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)**

### Start the app

To start the development server run `nx serve angular-basis-app`. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. Happy coding!

### Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

### Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```shell
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```shell
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```shell
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

### Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

### Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build basis-app` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Customizations

### .hintrc

Re-check the rules in the [.hintrc](.hintrc) file.

### Re-Check marked positions

Re-check as "CUSTOMIZATION" marked positions in the whole project.
